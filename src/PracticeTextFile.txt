Who is going to pull this file?
I am going to send a pull request to Tamara for this file.
Let us see what happens: can she merge?
After merge then we all need to "Pull" this file into IntellIj.
Think this is more of hitting the update button in IntellIj. Just wondering if we need to be in the master or a branch? Oh yeah I don't have a branch created.
